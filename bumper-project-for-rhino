Excellent project. Building a heavy-duty bumper for your 2nd Gen Ram is rewarding. Using pre-cut 3/8" A36 plate is a fantastic and common approach—it's stout enough for a serious winch bumper and can take serious abuse.

Mapping it out to create patterns (templates) is a critical step. Here’s a detailed, step-by-step methodology, moving from concept to cut-ready templates.

Phase 1: Design & Planning

1. Define Your Design Goals:

· Winch? If yes, decide on winch size (e.g., 12k lb) and mount style (behind fairlead plate or integrated cradle).
· Recovery Points: Integrated D-ring shackle mounts? They should be bolted through the main structure, not just welded to a surface.
· Approach Angles: How much tuck-up? Aggressive stinger or hoop?
· Mounting: Mimic the factory bumper's frame horn bolt pattern or design a new captive nut system. The 01 Ram frame rails are roughly 34.5" apart, outside-to-outside.
· Styling: Look at commercial bumpers (Iron Cross, Ranch Hand, ARB) for inspiration.

2. Create a "Design Hub":

· Take Critical Measurements:
  · Width between frame rails (inside and outside).
  · Distance from grill/radiator support to the front face of the frame horns.
  · Height from bottom of frame/bumper mount to bottom of grill.
  · Track width of your tires (for width reference).
  · Take lots of photos from straight on, the side, and above.

3. Initial Sketch:
Draw your idea on paper with approximate dimensions. This becomes your blueprint.

Phase 2: Creating Accurate Templates

This is the core of your question. You have two main paths: Low-Tech/Physical and Digital.

Method A: The Low-Tech / Hands-On Method (Very Effective)

This is the classic fabricator's approach, perfect for one-off parts.

1. Build a "Cardboard Mock-Up":
   · Materials: Large cardboard boxes (appliance boxes are perfect), duct tape, marker, sharp utility knife, straight edge.
   · Process:
     · Tape cardboard together to form large sheets.
     · Roughly cut a shape slightly larger than your planned bumper face plate.
     · Hold it against the truck. Trace the contour of the grill, headlights, and fender flares onto it. Mark centerlines, frame rail locations, etc.
     · Cut and fit iteratively. Use more cardboard and tape to create 3D structures for wings that wrap around the fenders.
   · For Complex Angles: If your side wings have compound angles, make a separate template for each plane. Use a contour gauge (a cheap tool from any hardware store) to copy the complex curve of your fender exactly, then transfer it to cardboard.
2. The "Break-It-Down" Strategy:
   Think of your bumper as a series of flat plates that will be welded together.
   · Main Plate Templates: Create separate templates for:
     · The Main Face Plate (the part everyone sees).
     · The Top Plate (slopes back to the grill).
     · The Bottom/Skid Plate (often angled for approach).
     · Two Side Wing Plates (wrap around fenders).
     · Internal Gussets/Stiffeners (triangles for strength).
     · Winch Mount Plate (if internal—this is crucial for fit).
   · Key Tip: Add weld allowance if needed. If two plates are to be butt-welded, your template can be exact. If one plate needs to fit over another, account for the thickness (3/8").
3. Transfer to Template Material:
   Once the cardboard fits perfectly, transfer the shape to a more durable template material:
   · 1/4" Hardboard/Masonite: Ideal. Easy to cut with a jigsaw, rigid, holds its shape.
   · Thin MDF or Plywood: Also works well.
   · Trace the cardboard shape, cut it out, and label it (e.g., "Face Plate - Center").

Method B: The Digital / CAD Method (Precise & Reusable)

This is the modern approach if you're comfortable with software.

1. Software Options:
   · Free/Consumer CAD: Fusion 360 (free for personal use) is the king for this. SketchUp (Free version) can work but is less precise for metal.
   · 2D Pattern Software: Inkscape (free vector graphics) is surprisingly powerful. You can take a scaled photo and trace over it.
   · The Pro Trick: Cardboard Aided Design (CAD) -> Digital. Make your cardboard mock-up, then lay it on a grid (like a 1" checkerboard) or against a known straight edge. Take a perfectly perpendicular photo with your phone. Import this photo into your software, scale it using a known dimension (e.g., frame rail width), and trace the digital outline. This gives you a scalable, editable template.
2. Process in CAD (e.g., Fusion 360):
   · Create a new sketch for each plate.
   · Draw the geometry using lines, arcs, and constraints.
   · Crucial: Model the parts in 3D and assemble them virtually. This will reveal fitment issues before you cut steel.
   · When perfect, create a 2D drawing or DXF file of each flat part. This DXF file is what a waterjet or laser cutting service uses. You can also print these at 1:1 scale on a tiled printer (like Staples Engineering Print) and tape the pages together to create a paper template.

Phase 3: Practical Execution & Safety Tips for Your Ram

· Mock-Up in Soft Material First: Before cutting $500 worth of A36, cut your templates out of cheap 1/4" MDF or even plywood. Assemble these with screws or hot glue. Hold this "wooden bumper" up to the truck. This is the ultimate test and is standard professional practice.
· Account for Mounting: Your templates for the main mounting plates that weld to the frame horns must account for the factory bolt holes. It's often best to use the factory bumper brackets as a starting point or design a new bracket that bolts to the existing holes.
· Winch Fitment: This is the tightest tolerance area. Know the exact dimensions of your winch (footprint, bolt pattern, gear housing size). Model or mock this up meticulously. Leave room for the winch clutch lever and wiring.
· A36 is Tough: 3/8" (0.375") A36 is a great choice but requires serious tools.
  · Cutting: A quality angle grinder with cut-off wheels, or better yet, a plasma cutter. A bandsaw is ideal for straight cuts.
  · Drilling: A heavy-duty drill press with cobalt or carbide step bits for shackle holes, or a mag drill for perfect, large-diameter holes.
  · Welding: MIG with 0.035" wire (C25 gas) or Stick welding (7018 rod) is required. You will need to bevel edges for multi-pass welds on critical joints. Pre-heating the A36 with a torch before welding thick sections is a good practice to prevent cracking.

Recommended Step-by-Step Summary:

1. Design on paper with goals in mind.
2. Take precise measurements and photos of your truck.
3. Create full-scale cardboard mock-ups for each major panel (Face, Top, Wings).
4. Refine cardboard until it fits the truck perfectly.
5. Transfer shapes to 1/4" hardboard for durable templates.
6. (Optional but highly recommended) Cut a mock-up from wood/cheap material and assemble.
7. Lay hardboard templates on your 3/8" A36 plate, scribe with a soapstone or painter's pencil.
8. Cut, bevel, fit, tack-weld, test-fit on truck, then final weld.

Final Pro Advice: Start simple. A basic, stout, winch-ready bumper with clean lines is better than a overly complex first project that doesn't fit. Pay obsessive attention to the mounting and winch plate—everything else is cosmetic armor.

Good luck, take your time on the templates, and post the results on the Cummins forums! That 24V will have a worthy new piece of armor.
